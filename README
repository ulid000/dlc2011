Code samples for node.js as used in session at DLC 2011.

To experiment with the samples please create an account for Cloud9IDE at http://c9.io and clone a project from the master or a appropriate branch. 

In Cloud9IDE you have to add the node module socket.io which is required by the server samples by typing

npm install socket.io

to the command line.
